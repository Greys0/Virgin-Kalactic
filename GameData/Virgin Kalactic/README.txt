Virgin Kalactic is a mod for Kerbal Space Program which currently impliments a method of modifying the behavior of Part beyond what is intended by Squad. This is used to enable the TrackResource project, which maintains a running statistic of last-frame resource consumption.

AdvancedGenerator is currently non-functional as it has not been updated to the changes in PartReplacement.PartTapIn

VirginGeneric is indifferent to these changes

Virgin Kalactic is designed mainly to appeal to developers and has only a few features that are directly accessible to the player during play time.
